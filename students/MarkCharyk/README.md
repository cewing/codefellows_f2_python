###### TA for CodeFellows Foundations II Python

### Who am I?
I'm a recent graduate of the CodeFellows Python Bootcamp which was an unequivocally awesome experience. I will be helping out with grading and question answering. I fell in love with Python since the first time I tried it and found out
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, world!");
}
```
was just
```python
print "Hello, world!"
```

To this day I still keep typing `pythong` on accident.

### What do I like?
Apart from code, I brew beer, run long distances, root for the Sounders and the Mariners, think about my dog too much, sing karaoke, use the Oxford comma, and [make bad jokes](https://www.twitter.com/markcharyk "My Twitter").

### Where can you find me?
I am planning on being around the CodeFellows office on Mondays leading up to class (5-7) and Thursdays during normal class time (7-9). 
If neither of those times work for you, let me know and I'm absolutely available to come in by appointment as well.
Email is also always good, and I occasionally hang around on IRC in the #codefellows channel where you are also welcome.
