## I am Pat Prendergast

####This is my Python Homework repo

####The Past
I grew up in California, *Palo Alto* to be specific. Software development was everywhere in my town growing up.  I learned some **BASIC** in grade school, probably soon after it was invented.  Alright, I am not _that_ old. I had to rebel, so software was out.

I moved up to Seattle (pre [web 2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0), as the riches of [web 1.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_1.0) were disappearing) for a Masters of Landscape Architecture degree at UW.  My focus was on geospatial data and landscape ecology.  I was working in shoreline/land use planning and GIS for a decade before switching to more entrepreneurial goals.

####The Present
I hope to use Python and web development skills to develop/prototype web and mobile products.  I hope these can include lots of useful data related to the past work I have been doing, while starting sustainable businesses.  

I also have a serious media problem...

*   books(printed, no less!), 
*   music, 
*   movies, 
*   games, 
*   news,
       NPR,
       magazines, 
       blogs. 
    
####A Find and a Definition
Finally, I found this [Dingus](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus), from the creator of Markdown.  It has a sidebar syntax cheatsheet and shows you a preview of the HTML source and result.

In case you were wondering, I think we can thank the South Africans for __'Dingus'__:

        ```
        ding·us
            ˈdiNGgəs/
        
        North American,  South African,  informal
        noun: dingus; plural noun: dinguses; noun: dinges; plural noun: dingeses

        used to refer to something whose name the speaker cannot remember, 
        is unsure of, or is humorously or euphemistically omitting.
        "here's a doohickey—and there's the dingus"
        ```


Be sure to use it in a sentence for practice.  Preferably with _thingamajig_, _doodad_, and _the whachamacallit gizmo_.
